Efficient parking management is a growing challenge in urban areas, leading to time wastage, increased 
traffic congestion, and environmental concerns. Parkyspot is a smart parking system designed to 
streamline the parking process by providing real-time availability, reservation, and booking 
functionalities for parking slots. Leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the system integrates IR 
sensors, ESP32 microcontrollers, and LEDs to monitor and display parking slot statuses (available, 
occupied, or reserved).The Parkyspot platform features a user-friendly web interface built using HTML, 
Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, supported by a MongoDB database for real-time data handling. Users can 
locate nearby parking areas, view slot statuses, and book slots with ease. Confirmed bookings generate 
QR codes, enhancing security and simplifying parking entry. This project successfully demonstrates how 
IoT and web technologies can create scalable, efficient, and user-centric solutions to modern urban 
challenges. Parkyspot contributes to the goals of digital transformation, sustainability, and convenience, 
paving the way for smart city innovations. Future developments could include mobile app integration, payment 
gateways, and AI-powered predictive analytics to further enhance functionality and user experience.
